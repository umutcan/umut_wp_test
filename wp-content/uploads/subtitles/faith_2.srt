1
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:19,300
Everyone has heard of Hwata,
the legendary skilled physician.
(Hwata = Chinese: Hua Tuo)

2
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:27,980
Wounds, poisoning, chronic illnesses 
of many decades,

3
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:31,720
there was nothing he could not cure.

4
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:37,320
But what was most amazing was
his talent for surgery.

5
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:40,790
Four patients with paralysis were
given general anesthesia,

6
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,520
then they were treated by having 
their bodies split open and internal 
organs removed.

7
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,470
At that same time, Jojo was 
campaigning to unify the world.
(Jojo = Chinese: Cao Cao)

8
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:57,870
He suffered from a chronic illness
of excruciating headaches.

9
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:03,210
Hwata went into his room and cured him 
easily using a few silver needles.

10
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:09,750
Jojo was so appreciative of Hwata's talent,
he wanted to make him his personal physician.

11
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:12,560
But Hwata fled instead.

12
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:18,160
He did not wish to spend his life
taking care of just one patient.

13
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:23,230
Jojo's men were ordered to pursue 
Hwata and bring him back.

14
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:25,640
"You just need to follow me back 
to meet the Prime Minister."

15
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:30,840
"You will enjoy endless wealth and 
glory for your remaining days."

16
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:37,250
"If a dog isn't allowed to bark, then what's 
the joy in having great wealth?"

17
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:42,190
"As long as you're willing to work 
for the Prime Minister, the whole 
world will sing your praises."

18
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:48,320
"See, Hwata is the miracle doctor who 
saved Jojo, the man who rules the world."

19
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:50,330
"What if I say no?"

20
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:54,200
"Those who defy him can only die."

21
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:59,670
"It looks as though Jojo is
going to be remembered

22
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:06,480
as the one who killed Hwata, the man 
who saved the lives of the world."

23
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:08,480
At that moment,

24
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:15,950
the sun in the heavens commanded
the wind and a portal opened.

25
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:23,830
Laughing and smiling... 
Hwata entered into the portal.

26
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:46,970
-= Episode 1 =-

27
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:52,000
-= Year 1351 - near the border with Yuan =-
(Yuan Dynasty- Mongol's dynasty in China
1271-1368)

28
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:19,350
Over there... Is it Hwata?

29
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:26,290
There are people following us.

30
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:28,690
I know.

31
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,100
From the look of it, they're not peasants.

32
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:35,100
I know.

33
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:20,080
1. 2. 3.

34
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:25,550
Is the boat ready?

35
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:30,490
General!  There aren't any boats.

36
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:32,090
What are you talking about?

37
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:33,820
How can there not be
a single boat available?

38
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:35,160
There just isn't.

39
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:39,030
They said there isn't a single boat
that can sail right now.

40
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:42,770
They said they expect two boats to
return tomorrow afternoon.

41
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:51,570
We will have to stay here overnight.

42
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:54,240
What do you mean stay?
Why here?

43
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,310
Goryeo is just across the river.
Exactly why...
(Goryeo - Korea)

44
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:58,920
As you wish.

45
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:01,990
Then I will have things ready.

46
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:05,460
Look here, Wudalchi!  Wudalchi!

47
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:09,330
I say, Wudalchi!

48
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:11,460
We should go and find an inn for the night.

49
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:22,010
Innkeeper, my master just got 
married recently.

50
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:24,540
But they are both extremely sensitive.

51
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:26,540
They wish only their own people
to take care of them.

52
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:29,480
Here, it's more than enough, right?

53
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:32,150
Just think of it as your lucky day.
Please go home and rest.

54
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:33,350
Yes.

55
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:35,220
Hurry and tell them all to leave.

56
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:37,890
It's closing time.
Finish eating and leave quickly.

57
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:39,220
Don't just stand there.

58
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:41,220
Customer, please.

59
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:44,290
What is this?

60
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:45,760
Let's go.

61
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:21,930
Do you think they got rid of the boats?

62
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,530
Probably.

63
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:29,140
Then do you think they also knew we 
would have to spend the night at an inn?

64
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:31,140
You said this was the only inn.

65
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:33,280
So you knew that and still chose 
to stay here?

66
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:38,080
Would you rather plant our flag  
in an open field and wait for them 
to attack us?

67
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:40,350
So how should we defend now?

68
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:46,090
Do it... very... well.

69
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:48,890
Yes.

70
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:55,170
Group A, close the windows and
block the doors using the tables.

71
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:58,370
The enemy arrived before us,

72
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:01,170
so we should be on high alert.

73
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:12,650
As soon as we arrive in Goryeo, 
the first thing you should do is 
kill that Wudalchi.

74
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:19,060
When I heard that this was the escort 
sent from Goryeo to protect you, I 
understood.

75
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:21,590
This is an insult!

76
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:23,190
Ten years.

77
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:27,460
Yes.  It's been more than 10 years
since Your Majesty has been home.

78
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:29,730
Yuan politely calls you a Prince of Goryeo.

79
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:35,340
When you were young, they forcibly 
took you there and held you as hostage.

80
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:39,880
Finally, Your Majesty is now
able to return to Goryeo.

81
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:42,680
But what is the meaning of this?

82
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:46,820
They should be waving hundreds of flags, 
with thousands of soldiers to escort you.

83
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:51,620
But what? You cannot wear your 
dragon robes and cannot show your face?

84
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:54,690
We cannot call you "Your Majesty"!

85
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:57,760
Of all the ridiculous, disrespectful...

86
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,230
Those bastards should all...!

87
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:06,300
I will be bringing the Queen 
to this room.

88
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:09,110
How dare you enter His Majesty's
quarters without knocking?

89
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:11,910
It is too difficult to guard multiple rooms.

90
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:16,980
I know that the two of you do not have 
the best relationship, but please understand.

91
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:19,380
You bastard!

92
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:21,650
Do you know how to use a sword?

93
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:26,060
Please guard that window.

94
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,730
Guard... What do you mean 
guard the window?

95
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,390
You...!

96
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:01,020
Where are you going?

97
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:03,560
You must stay near us so that we
can protect you.

98
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,830
I will take care of my own life.

99
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:46,730
There are more of them
than we expected.

100
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:50,470
Even if you are scared,
you must stay by my side.

101
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:53,270
Can you do that?

102
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:00,610
I will not run.

103
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:05,820
Then... I will be able to protect you.

104
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:55,050
Your Highness.
Your Highness.

105
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:03,730
Catch them alive!
Don't let them get away!

106
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,200
Jang Bin.

107
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,400
General.

108
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:16,140
I will need some of your energy.

109
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:41,730
-=Applying energy to slow the
blood flow and the heartbeat=-

110
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:03,140

111
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:37,690
Catch them!

112
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:39,290
Don't let even one of them escape!

113
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:44,090
Don't kill them!

114
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:47,300
I told you not to kill them.

115
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:51,430
What happened?
What is this?

116
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,370
Hey, didn't I tell you not to kill them, 
you bastards?

117
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:58,240
I said we needed to find out
who sent them!  Didn't I say that?

118
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:01,810
That's not it.

119
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,550
What's not it?

120
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:09,740
These bastards.
They killed themselves!

121
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:24,930
Doctor!  Doctor!  Dr. Jang, have you 
lost your senses?  What are you doing?

122
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:26,940
Just as you see, I'm currently 
treating the wounded.

123
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:31,470
You first must save the Queen.

124
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:33,880
Don't you understand the situation now?

125
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,880
We could all end up dead!

126
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,480
Here, let's go right now!

127
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:40,020
- Pharmacist!
- Yes?

128
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:41,620
Come and take care of this.

129
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:47,360
This could be the end of our Goryeo.

130
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:52,960
Your Majesty, you know who our Queen is.

131
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:55,900
She is a Yuan princess.

132
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,770
How can we just let her die by
the roadside?

133
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:02,840
There have been rumors saying that
Goryeo will become a vassal state of Yuan.

134
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,710
What will happen if their princess
dies here?

135
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:07,380
This would be the opportunity they
are looking for,

136
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:11,380
that would let them
swallow Goryeo whole.

137
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:13,920
Is there no hope for her?

138
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:16,720
The large blood vessel in her neck 
has been cut.

139
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:18,860
I've slowed the bleeding by reducing
the blood flow through acupuncture.

140
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:20,460
-=path through which the life-energy known as "qi" flows=-
I've slowed the bleeding by reducing

141
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:20,570
-=path through which the life-energy known as "qi" flows=-
But it's only a temporary measure.

142
00:17:20,570 --> 00:17:20,630
But it's only a temporary measure.

143
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:21,980
But it's only a temporary measure.

144
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:23,390
But it's only a temporary measure.

145
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:26,860
If the blood vessel is cut, 
just put it back together!

146
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:29,930
It was very difficult to slow her pulse.

147
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:35,410
If we disturb the blood energy by moving her,
she may bleed to death quickly.

148
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:39,940
No... No... We must save her.

149
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:42,880
Only a Divine Healer would be
able to save her.

150
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:44,350
What? A Divine Healer?

151
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:59,700
If that woman dies, our country dies.

152
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:03,300
Wudalchi, what do you think?

153
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:08,910
I'm just a warrior,
so I don't deal in politics.

154
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:16,650
It looks like as soon as I become king, 
the country is destroyed.

155
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:19,980
I'm quite a great king.

156
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:23,320
There is, Your Majesty,

157
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:26,920
a divine healer.

158
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,930
Very near here.

159
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:30,790
And I know where he is.

160
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:37,730
Where is he?
I'll have my men find him.

161
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:45,340
He is in Heaven, but I know where
the portal to the sky is.

162
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:47,480
Right over there.

163
00:18:56,820 --> 00:19:00,690
That is Dr. Jang.
He is considered the best healer in Goryeo.

164
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:05,100
Even he said it's impossible, so we can
now only appeal to Heaven.

165
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:08,430
If we do, would the Heavens save her?

166
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:13,770
What's important is you must pray to 
God with all your heart.

167
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:16,710
"The people were so sad to see
his profound grief."

168
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:20,040
"He fasted and prayed for her 
continuously for 3 days and 3 nights."

169
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:23,780
These are the kind of things that
those in Yuan should hear about.

170
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:28,180
So you think we can hold back 
their anger by doing all this?

171
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:31,520
This is all for Goryeo.

172
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:36,330
Then go and make the preparations.

173
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:39,400
You honor me.

174
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:46,340
Can Her Highness be moved?

175
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:47,940
No, she cannot.

176
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:52,210
I will divide the troops,
leaving most of the men here,

177
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:57,680
since it appears that their target
was the Queen.

178
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:06,890
Wudalchi.

179
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:18,900
It's very far from Goryeo to Yuan, right?

180
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,040
Yes, it's far.

181
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:25,180
What were you thinking along the way as
you escorted me over such a long distance?

182
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,650
I didn't really think much.

183
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:32,250
What I'm asking is, 
how did you see me as a King?

184
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:37,590
To have a wise and benevolent king

185
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:41,060
is really fortunate for the people.
This is what I thought.

186
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,670
Should I say more?

187
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:56,670
You... don't like me.

188
00:20:57,610 --> 00:20:58,410
Me?

189
00:20:58,410 --> 00:21:02,810
You didn't like me even before
you met me, right?

190
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:05,880
Your Majesty, if I were to answer that,

191
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:06,950
then I would have to die.

192
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:10,550
Why do you hate me?
I am your King.

193
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:13,620
Just tell me truthfully.

194
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:16,690
Will you tell me if I make it 
a royal command?

195
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:26,840
When the late Prince Gyeongchang 
ascended the throne, he was only 14.

196
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:31,780
Because he was too young to fulfill
his duties, Yuan had him dethroned.

197
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:33,910
I know.

198
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:35,780
Your Majesty is 21 years old.

199
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:39,920
Whether 14 or 21, they're both
too young for a king.

200
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,050
Moreover, you have lived in Yuan 
since the age of 10.

201
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:46,860
The Yuan way of thinking is in your bones.

202
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:50,330
"Our people of Goryeo are really unlucky

203
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:53,530
to have someone like this be the King."

204
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:56,600
That was what I was thinking.

205
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,800
That is all.

206
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:10,110
Everyone else probably thinks the
same way, right?

207
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:12,280
The people of Goryeo.

208
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:14,880
You're already the 5th King 
in the past 12 years.

209
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:19,420
I doubt they thought much
about it at all.

210
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:26,230
For telling me your true feelings, thank you.

211
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:32,900
Your Majesty.

212
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:45,580
That means I don't especially dislike you.

213
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:54,930
-=King Gongmin, Goryeo's 31st King.=-

214
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:59,010
-=Choe Yeong, General of the 
Wudalchi (Royal Guards) at the time.=-

215
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,980
Your Majesty.

216
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:24,690
It is said that this natural spring,

217
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:26,690
is the legendary portal through which

218
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:30,690
Hwata flew to the Heavens 1000 years ago.

219
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:34,300
While in the Heavens, Hwata has
nurtured many disciples.

220
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:39,100
Once every 300 years, his disciples
may enter our world through this portal.

221
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:40,440
That is how the legend goes.

222
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:44,710
In other words, you think we should
pray through this small opening?

223
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:48,580
It's not just an opening,
but a portal to the Heavens.

224
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:55,610
What is that?

225
00:23:55,650 --> 00:23:57,980
Group B, be on your guard!

226
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:04,810
Group A, guard the outside!

227
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:16,210
Your Majesty, Heavens' gate is open!
Heavens' gate is open!

228
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:19,280
If you go through there, Your Majesty, 
you will meet the Divine Healer, Hwata.

229
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,280
Your Majesty, please command 
for him to come.

230
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:26,750
No matter if it's Hwata or
one of his disciples.

231
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:30,620
You must bring him before the
portal closes!

232
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:31,690
Quickly, Your Majesty!

233
00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:34,220
Since you seem to know so much,
you should go.

234
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:37,020
You bastard.

235
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:40,920
The one who can save the Queen,

236
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:44,500
Heaven's Divine Healer is 
in there, Your Majesty.

237
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:04,250
Even though I can't believe 
everything he says...

238
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:08,710
Please give me your order.

239
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:11,330
We at least have to give it a try, right?

240
00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:16,670
I will go.

241
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:27,340
General.

242
00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:31,960
This is a royal order.

243
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,120
General!

244
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:41,790
Dae Man!

245
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:51,950
Hey. Did you see? 
You saw it, right?

246
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:52,760
What?

247
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:55,570
Over there, someone came out.

248
00:26:56,230 --> 00:26:57,030
You're seeing things.

249
00:26:57,430 --> 00:26:59,300
Really. Look, look.

250
00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:00,500
What?

251
00:27:12,730 --> 00:27:14,660
-=2012, Seoul =-

252
00:27:30,130 --> 00:27:34,400
=An alert has been issued due to a
multilevel sunspot explosion.=

-=and are now using the Arctic route.=-

257
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:50,610
Master.

258
00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:53,550
Excuse me, Master.

259
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:03,690
I have come from a different land. 
My name is Choe Yeong.

260
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:04,760
A different land?

261
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:08,230
I know that I do not belong here,

262
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:10,100
but please help me.

263
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:12,100
How can I help you?

264
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:14,240
I'm looking for a Divine Healer.

265
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,440
Divine Healer?

266
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,970
I heard that Hwata came here.

267
00:29:17,970 --> 00:29:21,180
Hwata...

268
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:23,310
Ah, a doctor, right?

269
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:24,510
Yes.

270
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:26,780
Doctors have many different specialties.

271
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:29,850
Internal medicine, surgeons, OB/GYN,
dentists.

272
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:32,920
Where is the problem?

273
00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:36,790
This part.

274
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:39,600
That part... Ah, a plastic surgeon!

275
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,330
Do you know where they are?

276
00:29:41,330 --> 00:29:43,070
There are a lot of plastic surgeons here.

277
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:45,600
This is Gangnam.

278
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,470
Not just any doctor,

279
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:49,470
It must be a Divine Healer.

280
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:52,140
You must be looking for a famous one.

281
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:55,350
Oh, I saw a banner.

282
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:58,420
There's a plastic surgery convention
at the COEX.

283
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:02,290
There should be a lot of famous
ones there.

284
00:30:02,290 --> 00:30:02,820
CO...

285
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:05,220
COEX.

286
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,690
Which direction?

287
00:30:06,690 --> 00:30:08,430
It's over there.

288
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:10,430
You see it?

289
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:14,960
If it's the one over there, 
I was just there.

290
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,970
But...

291
00:30:16,970 --> 00:30:18,970
how should I go there?

292
00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:20,970
You can just... go.

293
00:30:20,970 --> 00:30:26,180
I... just... go?

294
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:31,780
As expected.

295
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:35,120
Thank you for your lesson.

296
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:45,930
Master Hye Jeong, are they shooting
a candid camera bit in our temple?

297
00:30:45,930 --> 00:30:49,400
If they were shooting a drama, 
I would've known.

298
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,800
You don't know either?

299
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:54,740
Hello? Hello?

300
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:58,880
This lousy phone, what's wrong with it?

301
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:17,690
Just... go.

302
00:32:33,770 --> 00:32:36,970
A technique that has been used since
the 70s to remove wrinkles,

303
00:32:36,970 --> 00:32:38,710
the subcutaneous lift,

304
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:41,640
also called a minimal access 
cranial suspension lift.

305
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,510
Just like that, an incision from 
the scalp behind the ear

306
00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:45,650
to the front of the ear.

307
00:32:45,650 --> 00:32:48,850
We then pull the skin after separating it
from the subcutaneous layer, 
(subcutaneous - the lowermost layer of skin)

308
00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:51,920
and trim off the excess skin.

309
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:54,990
This shows how we separate the skin
from the subcutaneous layer.

310
00:32:54,990 --> 00:32:57,260
If you're not very careful,

311
00:32:57,260 --> 00:33:00,730
you might touch one of these 
blood vessels.

312
00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:03,000
You need be very focused here.

313
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:09,410
This is how we suture the skin closed.

314
00:33:09,410 --> 00:33:12,080
This photo is 10 days after the surgery.

315
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:15,010
As you can see, there is a small scar.

316
00:33:15,010 --> 00:33:18,750
Not only does the surgery leave a scar,
but it has many other flaws.

317
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:23,820
The most serious flaw is that 
its effect doesn't last very long.

318
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:26,890
The patients who underwent this surgery...

319
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:34,760
They have had to return to the doctor 
again in about 2 years.

320
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:38,100
Because they will have to do it again.

321
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:49,310
Next, I'll introduce the surgery
called the AccuLift.

322
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:53,850
It's been recognized worldwide as the 
remedy to the problems with past procedures.

323
00:33:56,390 --> 00:33:58,920
I don't know. I'm so unlucky.

324
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:04,130
Some idiot barged in and messed up 
my whole presentation.

325
00:34:04,130 --> 00:34:06,260
It's just not my day.

326
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:08,400
I woke up this morning with a 
massive headache.

327
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:13,200
That petty Dr. O, only cares about the
male doctors, never me.

328
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:16,940
I really can't stand it anymore.

329
00:34:17,610 --> 00:34:19,210
Just wait and see.

330
00:34:19,210 --> 00:34:23,480
In 3 years' time, I will definitely 
open a clinic in Gangnam.

331
00:34:27,350 --> 00:34:29,750
Speaking of which,

332
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:32,560
how about investing in my clinic?

333
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:37,490
Rotten girl. Didn't you marry a rich man?

334
00:34:37,490 --> 00:34:39,360
Spend some of that money!

335
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:44,430
Look here, ajussi.

336
00:34:44,430 --> 00:34:47,100
Which of these companies hired
you for promotion?

337
00:34:48,570 --> 00:34:50,040
Look here, ajussi!

338
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:52,580
I'm asking which company you're with.

339
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:54,310
Do you have an entrance pass?

340
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:02,850
Hey. Are you deaf?

341
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:04,720
Hey, Ajussi.

342
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:08,320
How can I go inside there?

343
00:35:09,390 --> 00:35:11,660
I have to get inside.

344
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:13,660
Please open this for me.

345
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:16,330
This doctor inside here,

346
00:35:16,330 --> 00:35:17,800
I have to meet her.

347
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,670
A doctor?

348
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:22,470
Are you playing with me?

349
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:25,410
We don't have time for fooling around.

350
00:35:25,410 --> 00:35:27,810
These clothes...

351
00:35:27,810 --> 00:35:30,610
What is this?

352
00:35:30,610 --> 00:35:34,080
Is it ketchup?

353
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,950
Wow, look at this.

354
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:40,360
Wait wait wait wait,
let's talk.

355
00:35:42,490 --> 00:35:44,090
Wait, wait.  I'm fine.

356
00:35:44,090 --> 00:35:48,100
You... you just assaulted me.

357
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,840
Call the police quick!

358
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:56,240
Tell them there's a crazy man here

359
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:59,040
who's assaulting personnel and
damaging property.

360
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,780
And... that...

361
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:02,780
he's carrying an illegal weapon.

362
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:05,450
You're in so much trouble now.

363
00:36:05,450 --> 00:36:06,920
You jerk!

364
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:13,590
Run! Run!

365
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:30,010
Oh Doctor, how are you?

366
00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:31,340
Please come and take a look.

367
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:34,810
Doctor, these days you must have 
state of the art equipment.

368
00:36:34,810 --> 00:36:36,280
Please have a look at these.

369
00:36:39,350 --> 00:36:42,150
This has an optical zoom of 2.5x.

370
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:45,890
It's manufactured using an ultra-light alloy.
You have no idea how great it is.

371
00:36:45,890 --> 00:36:48,560
Some doctors have even forgotten to
take them off after an operation.

372
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,690
They just end up wearing them home.

373
00:36:50,690 --> 00:36:56,030
And in the middle, there is an
LED light that flashes on and off...

374
00:36:57,230 --> 00:37:04,040
Wow. These days some companies are
promoting using special methods.

375
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:06,580
So he's working dressed like that?

376
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:08,310
I thought he was an extra from a drama.

377
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:11,380
Look at that makeup.

378
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,790
He's coming over.

379
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:21,520
There's an urgent patient.

380
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,590
So?

381
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:24,190
According to our physician,

382
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:26,730
the vein on her neck was severed.

383
00:37:26,730 --> 00:37:28,600
Can you save that patient?

384
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:31,400
Why are you asking me?

385
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,800
Can you save that patient?

386
00:37:38,210 --> 00:37:41,010
Doesn't he seem a bit strange?

387
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:43,550
I think he's trying to flirt with you.

388
00:37:43,550 --> 00:37:44,880
Can you send me the brochure for this?

389
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,620
Of course.

390
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:49,550
Write down the address of your 
hospital and I'll send it right over.

391
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:51,290
Okay.

392
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:58,230
That's him... him.

393
00:37:58,230 --> 00:38:00,360
The sword on him is real.

394
00:38:02,770 --> 00:38:05,040
Please put down your weapon!

395
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,900
Put down your weapon!

396
00:38:08,510 --> 00:38:12,780
That patient, can you save them?

397
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:15,310
I'd have to see the patient first
before I know.

398
00:38:15,310 --> 00:38:17,980
Where and how much the patient is hurt...

399
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:20,650
How much they are hurt...

400
00:38:20,650 --> 00:38:22,650
You have to see for yourself?

401
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:27,460
Put the sword down!

402
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:52,420
Why did you have to follow me?

403
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:05,100
Her wound from the sword 
looks just like this.

404
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:07,360
The depth is almost the same too.

405
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:09,630
Can you save him?

406
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:12,840
Ambulance! Quickly, call 119!

407
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:13,640
Yes.

408
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:16,710
If you can't save this person,

409
00:39:16,710 --> 00:39:18,980
then I'll just try again, with him.

410
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:22,310
Please spare me!

411
00:39:22,310 --> 00:39:26,850
Please spare me! 
Please spare me!

412
00:39:26,850 --> 00:39:28,720
Please spare me!

413
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:34,460
You want me to save him?

414
00:39:35,530 --> 00:39:37,390
This person?  Right here?

415
00:39:37,390 --> 00:39:40,060
We don't have much time.

416
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:41,930
Please get started.

417
00:40:08,890 --> 00:40:11,290
I need the proper instruments.

418
00:40:11,290 --> 00:40:14,360
I need surgical clamps and hooks...

419
00:40:43,330 --> 00:40:45,060
Oh God, our Father!

420
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:47,730
If you will spare me from death, I will...

421
00:40:47,730 --> 00:40:48,400
Please hold this here...

422
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:55,470
Please forgive my sins and lead me
through this...

423
00:40:55,470 --> 00:40:57,870
Yes?

424
00:40:57,870 --> 00:41:00,810
If this person dies, you will be next.

425
00:41:00,810 --> 00:41:02,280
What?

426
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:06,200
Ah! Yes, yes.

427
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:08,230
Mask.

428
00:41:09,890 --> 00:41:10,510
Sterilize.

429
00:41:10,690 --> 00:41:12,290
Ah, sterilize, sterilize.

430
00:41:38,310 --> 00:41:40,580
I have stopped the bleeding with a clamp.

431
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:44,990
I need to suture it closed immediately, 
so hold this.

432
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,130
=This is the Gangnam Police Force, 
Officer Pak speaking.=

433
00:41:55,670 --> 00:41:59,000
=What is the situation in there?
Is there anyone who can reply?=

434
00:42:03,410 --> 00:42:07,010
=I will call the phone inside.  
Please answer and talk to us.=

435
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:09,410
=I'm calling now.=

436
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:27,560
- Hey.  Isn't it done yet?
- Not yet.

437
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:37,440
The hostages are a man and a woman.

438
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:39,830
According to witnesses, he wounded a 
security guard with a sword.

439
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:42,650
We believe he may be mentally ill.

440
00:42:44,250 --> 00:42:47,050
We can't wait much longer because
the injured person's condition is not good.

441
00:42:47,450 --> 00:42:55,520
Tie, cut.

442
00:43:04,530 --> 00:43:05,740
You've worked hard.

443
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:09,210
Excuse me, are we done?

444
00:43:12,410 --> 00:43:15,750
This man... is alive.

445
00:43:16,810 --> 00:43:20,720
We will have to wait and see.
He also needs antibiotics.

446
00:43:20,820 --> 00:43:26,690
He's alive! Look.  So the surgery
was successful, right?

447
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:28,960
I need you to come with me.

448
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:31,230
Me? Why?

449
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:33,230
You need to save a person.

450
00:43:33,630 --> 00:43:36,830
Ajussi, it's been a long time since I
stopped being a surgeon.  Besides...

451
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:44,970
It may be difficult for you to enter
my world, so please stay behind me.

452
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:46,710
That, Ajussi, I...

453
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:49,510
Don't get lost, follow closely.

454
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:09,930
The suspect is coming out with the hostage.
Everyone get in your positions.

455
00:44:11,130 --> 00:44:14,070
Why can't you just do as I say?

456
00:44:14,470 --> 00:44:18,610
Go where?
There are police everywhere out there.
How are we going to get out?

457
00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:22,480
We'll break through the front.

458
00:44:25,550 --> 00:44:29,550
Lock down. Lock down!
They are going out!

459
00:44:31,690 --> 00:44:36,360
Ajussi, wait. Ajussi, really...

460
00:44:39,430 --> 00:44:40,630
Ajussi!

461
00:44:56,250 --> 00:44:59,980
Ajussi, why don't you surrender, okay?

462
00:45:06,790 --> 00:45:08,390
Please surrender!

463
00:45:36,630 --> 00:45:39,490
Please forgive this discourtesy.

464
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:41,090
What do you mean?

465
00:45:54,700 --> 00:45:56,170
Please spare me!

466
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:58,170
All you have to do is go in there.

467
00:46:02,850 --> 00:46:04,310
Please let me go. Let me go.

468
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:06,450
I won't kill you.

469
00:46:07,250 --> 00:46:10,720
As long as you save her, 
I will bring you back.

470
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:15,930
Lies! I've seen your face already.

471
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:22,870
In movies, if you see the kidnapper's face,
you always get killed.  I know that!

472
00:46:29,810 --> 00:46:33,940
I am Choe Yeong, a Goryeo warrior.

473
00:46:35,150 --> 00:46:41,550
I swear on my life and my honor as
a warrior, I'll send you back if you save her.

474
00:46:42,750 --> 00:46:44,090
I promise.

475
00:47:03,130 --> 00:47:05,890
-=Seoul. 10 days ago=-

476
00:47:07,710 --> 00:47:09,850
So, what do you want to know?

477
00:47:10,510 --> 00:47:14,380
A man.  My man.
When and where will I meet him?

478
00:47:14,650 --> 00:47:15,850
May I have your date of birth?

479
00:47:17,590 --> 00:47:19,190
This is my name and birth date.

480
00:47:19,590 --> 00:47:23,190
But not just any man.
He must have lots of money.

481
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:29,290
If I asked you for next week's winning
Lotto numbers, would you tell me?

482
00:47:29,470 --> 00:47:32,800
Of course not.
I would have already done it if I could.

483
00:47:33,340 --> 00:47:39,210
As I was saying, when and where
will I meet a rich man?

484
00:47:39,610 --> 00:47:41,080
Okay... Okay...

485
00:47:41,570 --> 00:47:45,580
-=Incantation=-

486
00:47:48,820 --> 00:47:50,690
If possible, it would be nice if
he was warm and kind.

487
00:47:53,490 --> 00:47:57,360
But a rich man doesn't have to 
be ugly, right?

488
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:06,840
You were born on May 5th?
There will be light shining between 
Heaven and Earth.

489
00:48:07,370 --> 00:48:13,510
You will only meet that man during that time.

490
00:48:14,180 --> 00:48:17,780
The one who will fulfill your wishes.

491
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:25,920
What is it?
Where will I meet him?

492
00:48:28,460 --> 00:48:30,730
It would be better if it can be as soon
as possible.  I kind of need money.

493
00:48:30,990 --> 00:48:33,260
But it's not for brand name bags 
or anything.

494
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:38,330
I'm in a middle of a research project,
regarding stem cell extraction.

495
00:48:38,740 --> 00:48:44,340
And it's at the crucial period now,
but all the research funds have been exhausted.

496
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:55,950
Wow! Hey... This is incredible.
Give me your hand.

497
00:48:56,490 --> 00:48:57,690
What is it?

498
00:49:01,420 --> 00:49:08,370
What this divination is saying,
it's saying...

499
00:49:11,030 --> 00:49:18,640
I have to look at the book.
This type of divination is unique.
Let me take a look.

500
00:49:20,110 --> 00:49:23,450
He is the man sent from Heaven.

501
00:49:24,510 --> 00:49:27,180
Omo, omo. A man sent from Heaven?
(Omo - Oh my)

502
00:49:28,390 --> 00:49:30,120
But...

503
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:30,920
But?

504
00:49:31,190 --> 00:49:33,590
He is a man from the past.

505
00:49:34,390 --> 00:49:35,510
From the past?

506
00:49:35,590 --> 00:49:44,130
Think about men you have dated before.

507
00:49:44,530 --> 00:49:45,200
Sorry?

508
00:49:45,470 --> 00:49:52,540
The man that Heaven sent you 
must be among them.

509
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:56,150
That is what the divination said.

510
00:49:58,420 --> 00:50:00,420
Do you mean...

511
00:50:04,950 --> 00:50:08,430
<i>During my student and intern period,
there was a man I dated <i>

512
00:50:08,830 --> 00:50:10,690
<i>for 3 years and 4 months,
my seonbae.</i>
(seonbae - senior, mentor)

513
00:50:11,090 --> 00:50:14,830
<i>He had me do his graduate 
thesis when he was a senior.</i>

514
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:28,310
<i>Seonbae, you were on night duty, 
so you haven't had breakfast, right?</i>

515
00:50:28,710 --> 00:50:31,510
<i>I brought you some food.  
I made it myself. </i>

516
00:50:33,650 --> 00:50:38,460
<i>Wait.  Which is the tuna? 
No, not this.  This is radish. This is it.</i>

517
00:50:39,260 --> 00:50:40,460
<i>Eun Su.</i>

518
00:50:40,860 --> 00:50:41,930
<i>You want this?</i>

519
00:50:42,460 --> 00:50:43,530
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

520
00:50:44,060 --> 00:50:45,130
<i>You've eaten already?</i>

521
00:50:45,930 --> 00:50:47,660
<i>I have another woman.</i>

522
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:57,270
<i>Her family is very rich, and she 
said she will open a clinic for me. </i>

523
00:50:57,940 --> 00:51:00,610
<i>Exactly how rich?</i>

524
00:51:01,410 --> 00:51:04,610
<i>I heard that they have 
several buildings in Gangnam.</i>

525
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:06,480
<i>Oh...</i>

526
00:51:10,750 --> 00:51:16,230
<i>That woman is much uglier than you,
and her personality is bad, too. </i>

527
00:51:16,890 --> 00:51:21,030
<i>But what can I do?
She's building a clinic for me. </i>

528
00:51:27,700 --> 00:51:29,310
<i>Sorry.</i>

529
00:51:35,180 --> 00:51:37,050
<i>I'm leaving first.</i>

530
00:51:50,790 --> 00:51:59,200
The second man I think really liked me.
Whenever he saw me, he would nearly die.

531
00:52:03,340 --> 00:52:09,350
<i>Here and here, we can fill it 
up a bit more.</i>

532
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:12,950
<i>We can do a little bone shaving here.</i>

533
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:19,490
<i>Don't worry, we'll use general anesthesia.
Do you want some botox injections?</i>

534
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:21,090
<i>If you want a V-line in your face, then---</i>

535
00:52:21,620 --> 00:52:22,450
<i>Dr. Yu.</i>

536
00:52:22,690 --> 00:52:23,490
<i>Yes?</i>

537
00:52:24,930 --> 00:52:26,090
<i>Eun Su.</i>

538
00:52:37,770 --> 00:52:39,780
I think we dated for about 3 months?

539
00:52:42,450 --> 00:52:44,710
So then?

540
00:52:45,250 --> 00:52:46,320
I couldn't do it anymore.

541
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:48,990
Even if he was rich, I just couldn't bear it.

542
00:52:49,650 --> 00:52:52,320
Didn't you say you wanted a rich man?

543
00:52:53,260 --> 00:52:54,320
It wouldn't be him, right?

544
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:56,060
A man sent from Heaven...

545
00:52:57,790 --> 00:52:59,800
Sent for you by Heaven.

546
00:53:00,330 --> 00:53:03,130
To be honest, I don't want to 
get married yet.

547
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:05,800
Just getting engaged will be good enough.

548
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:09,900
If I get the money, I can finish
my research project.

549
00:53:09,940 --> 00:53:12,240
There's a company that will purchase
the patent.

550
00:53:12,340 --> 00:53:17,550
If that happens, then I can repay the 
loan and cancel the engagement.

551
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:19,950
That would really be awesome!

552
00:53:24,350 --> 00:53:28,490
But, that's not going to happen.

553
00:53:28,890 --> 00:53:29,960
Why not?

554
00:53:31,030 --> 00:53:33,030
Let's try the next divination.

555
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:49,880
-=The Hexagram Sequence=-

556
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:52,380
The pronunciation of this sign
is really difficult.

557
00:53:55,450 --> 00:54:02,790
It says, you will soon go on a 
long journey for one year.

558
00:54:03,590 --> 00:54:06,530
Where would I go?
I barely got this job at this hospital.

559
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:07,600
How can I just leave?

560
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:13,870
In other words, this divination
is a travel sign.

561
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:16,540
This is an auspicious sign.

562
00:54:22,150 --> 00:54:27,620
You will meet him if you go through
the doorway.  You will only achieve 
this after you meet him.

563
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:29,500
So what I want to know is about that man.

564
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:32,560
That rich man, where and 
how do I meet him?

565
00:54:32,820 --> 00:54:35,090
It's already been arranged 
by the Heavens.

566
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:38,700
There are so many people who never 
get to meet their Heaven-sent person.

567
00:54:38,830 --> 00:54:42,170
So many... it's uncountable.

568
00:54:42,830 --> 00:54:44,570
Really...

569
00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:47,500
Forget it. I'm going.
This person...

570
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:51,110
Think hard. Try to remember.

571
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:54,310
Try to remember.

572
00:54:55,510 --> 00:54:59,780
Perhaps a brief encounter among 
the sea of people from your past.

573
00:55:01,790 --> 00:55:07,390
I heard in this building,
there is an amazing tarot master.
Do you know where he is?

574
00:55:09,130 --> 00:55:12,460
Oh, that question was a bit rude.
I'm sorry, I'll leave.

575
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:19,400
<i>Man from the past?
Does he think I'm an idiot?
Such a swindler.  Seriously.</i>

576
00:55:21,140 --> 00:55:21,810
-=7 years ago (Goryeo period)=-

577
00:55:21,810 --> 00:55:23,140
-=7 years ago (Goryeo period)=-
Have you heard?

578
00:55:23,140 --> 00:55:24,520
-=7 years ago (Goryeo period)=-

579
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:28,880
The newly appointed leader of 
the Wudalchi is...

580
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:30,080
His age...

581
00:55:31,950 --> 00:55:33,420
He is only...

582
00:55:33,820 --> 00:55:35,690
He is only 22 years old.

583
00:55:35,820 --> 00:55:38,490
But he was the leader of the Joekwoldae.

584
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:42,890
<i>But, there are rumors that our new 
General has some impressive skills.</i>

585
00:55:42,890 --> 00:55:44,760
<i>Killing 3 enemies with 1 
swing of his sword.</i>

586
00:55:44,890 --> 00:55:47,160
<i>Astonishing levitation.</i>

587
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:52,240
<i>He can jump over a city wall 
with one leap. </i>

588
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:55,310
<i>You've all heard that the Joekwoldae 
people have special powers?</i>

589
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:58,780
<i>It is said that our new General
has a lightning power, </i>

590
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:02,650
<i>where lightning bolts shoot
from his hands.</i>

591
00:56:02,650 --> 00:56:05,320
<i>It is also said that he has a 
nasty temper.</i>

592
00:56:05,450 --> 00:56:07,180
<i>There was once someone who
woke him from his sleep,</i>

593
00:56:07,450 --> 00:56:09,320
<i>and he nearly killed him.</i>

594
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:12,390
Kid, that's just a tall tale.

595
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:14,790
To be honest,

596
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:20,930
people from the Joekwoldae kill their
enemies just by sneaking up on them.

597
00:56:21,060 --> 00:56:22,530
You can't say that.

598
00:56:22,930 --> 00:56:24,930
They have killed many many 
enemy commanders.

599
00:56:25,070 --> 00:56:26,400
And you're really willing

600
00:56:26,540 --> 00:56:30,540
to give that General spot to a 
kid who's still so green?

601
00:56:30,810 --> 00:56:32,540
He's was personally appointed by the King.

602
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:36,150
Rumor has it,

603
00:56:36,950 --> 00:56:39,880
that he wasn't appointed because 
the King favors him,

604
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:44,820
but because he wanted him to suffer.

605
00:56:45,220 --> 00:56:46,560
Shut up.

606
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:49,760
None of you know anything
about the Joekwoldae.

607
00:56:50,290 --> 00:56:54,030
Because of the Joekwoldae, our Goryeo 
is still standing.

608
00:56:54,030 --> 00:56:55,900
Aigoo. Seriously.

609
00:56:56,570 --> 00:56:58,440
Deputy General, you just sit and watch.

610
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:05,380
When he comes, watch how I
kick his butt.

611
00:57:09,110 --> 00:57:11,510
Please identify yourself.

612
00:57:12,180 --> 00:57:15,650
Didn't you hear our
Deputy General's question?

613
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:18,590
Who are you?

614
00:57:18,590 --> 00:57:22,730
Are you ignoring me?

615
00:57:27,660 --> 00:57:29,800
Are you the one in charge here?

616
00:57:29,930 --> 00:57:33,270
I am Wudalchi's Deputy General, 
Bae Chung Seok. You are?

617
00:57:36,340 --> 00:57:38,210
Where do I sleep?

618
00:57:38,610 --> 00:57:39,810
What?

619
00:57:40,080 --> 00:57:41,680
They said I would get it when 
I came here...

620
00:57:41,950 --> 00:57:43,410
my bed.

621
00:58:09,170 --> 00:58:11,040
He got here the day before yesterday, right?

622
00:58:11,170 --> 00:58:13,710
For 3 days and 2 nights he has
done nothing but sleep, not eating.

623
00:58:13,980 --> 00:58:16,380
Right. He hasn't even had to pee.

624
00:58:16,650 --> 00:58:18,250
Do you think he's dead?

625
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:20,650
I heard that people die in their sleep.

626
00:58:21,050 --> 00:58:25,190
I put my hand under his nose to see
if he was still breathing, and he is.

627
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:42,140
Deol Bae.

628
00:58:42,410 --> 00:58:43,610
Those rumors. Are they true?

629
00:58:43,870 --> 00:58:46,010
What rumors?

630
00:58:46,680 --> 00:58:47,880
That person who only sleeps,

631
00:58:48,140 --> 00:58:52,150
can he really kill 3 people with 1 swing,
leap over a high wall with a jump,

632
00:58:52,550 --> 00:58:55,090
and shoot lightning from his hands?

633
00:58:55,750 --> 00:58:56,950
How can such person exist in this world?

634
00:58:57,350 --> 00:58:57,890
He does.

635
00:58:58,420 --> 00:59:00,820
Those are just rumors. 
Go wake him up.

636
00:59:01,090 --> 00:59:04,960
I don't care if he's the new general or
not, I'm going to try fighting him.

637
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:08,570
Don't! What if you really wake him?

638
00:59:08,970 --> 00:59:12,840
Didn't you hear that he nearly beat
a man to death for waking him up?

639
00:59:13,240 --> 00:59:16,440
Deok Man, get out of the way.

640
01:00:19,700 --> 01:00:22,750

641
01:00:22,780 --> 01:00:25,380
I, as a warrior for this country,

642
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:28,080
think that you as a King should have some
form of self-discipline.

643
01:00:28,110 --> 01:00:29,270
That is what I believe.

644
01:00:29,300 --> 01:00:30,100
Can I believe that,

645
01:00:30,100 --> 01:00:33,900
the Heavens are still protecting this country?

646
01:00:33,930 --> 01:00:35,030
That person is really weird.

647
01:00:35,030 --> 01:00:36,440
Can you speak English?

648
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:37,600
How do you do? Thank you.

649
01:00:37,610 --> 01:00:38,390
Telephone.

650
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:39,800
Phone.

651
01:00:39,820 --> 01:00:41,080
How can the village studio be so big?

652
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:42,290
Catch that woman!

653
01:00:42,290 --> 01:00:46,630
Who dares to ignore me?
Come out. Come out now!

654
01:00:46,630 --> 01:00:47,950
After considering over and over again,

655
01:00:47,970 --> 01:00:51,000
I still believe they are insignificant.

656
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:54,560
Since we have already started,
we should walk through the end.
