== Description ==
Clear sky of late autumn, like the calm endless sea, strong white light beating in the air, like the ripples on the sea; plump ears of the rice swaying from time to time at the foot of the mountain, like the fluctuation of the red water; withered yellow leaves put the depressed color on the field.
